🧠 Paddy Yield and Quality Analysis using Deep Learning

A smart image-based system that detects whether a paddy crop is healthy or pest-affected using CNN, ResNet, and EfficientNet models.

🚀 How It Works

User uploads a paddy image.

Image is preprocessed and analyzed by three AI models.

System predicts: Healthy 🌾 or Pested 🐛.

Results are stored in the database.
